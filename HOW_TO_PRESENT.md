### Option 2: Send-First Approach (If Remote/Busy)

**Perfect if Anthony is time-pressed or wants to review before meeting**

**Step 1: Send the One-Pager (Email)**
```
Hi Anthony,

Quick follow-up on our KTFS mortgage renewal automation chat.

I've put together a complete project plan. Here's the one-page
summary to start:

[Attach or link: KTFS_one_page_summary.md]

Key points:
‚Ä¢ Automated SMS reminders at 6, 5, 4 months before expiry
‚Ä¢ Two-way booking via text (integrated with Reapit)
‚Ä¢ Smart escalation to advisors
‚Ä¢ Investment: ¬£1,000 + ¬£500/month (¬£8,440 Year 1)
‚Ä¢ Launch: 11th November

Let me know when you have 30 mins to walk through it together.

Oliver
```

**Step 2: They Review on Their Own**

**Step 3: Schedule Follow-Up Call**
- Answer questions
- Review specific sections they flagged
- Get approvals
- Collect information needed

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)

**Day 1: Send Materials**
- Email the one-page summary
- Link to GitHub repo with all docs
- "Have a look, let's chat tomorrow"

**Day 2: 30-Minute Focused Call**
- Assume they've skimmed the materials
- Jump straight to their questions
- Focus on what matters to them
- Get decisions and approvals
- Don't re-present everything

## üé® How to Use PRESENTATION.md

### As a Visual Deck
The markdown is formatted to be read as slides. Each `---` separator is a new slide.

**To present directly from Markdown:**
1. Open PRESENTATION.md in a markdown viewer
2. Use arrow keys to navigate slides
3. Present in full-screen mode

**To convert to PowerPoint/Slides:**
1. Use a tool like Marp (marp.app) or Slidev
2. Or manually copy sections into PowerPoint
3. Add KTFS branding/colors

### Key Slides to Emphasize

**Business Case:**
- Slide 6 (Investment & ROI) - This is the money slide
- Slide 20 (Projected Results) - Conservative to optimistic scenarios

**How It Works:**
- Slides 4-5 (3 steps) - Keep it simple
- Slides 12-19 (John Smith journey) - Make it real and relatable

**Closing:**
- Slide 34 ("Imagine This...") - Paint the vision
- Slide 36 ("Let's Build This") - Call to action

## üí° Presentation Tips

### Do's
‚úÖ **Start with the problem** - They have 1,000 leads, manual tracking sucks
‚úÖ **Show real examples** - John Smith journey is relatable
‚úÖ **Focus on ROI** - System pays for itself with 19 renewals
‚úÖ **Emphasize low risk** - Pilot with 100 first, adjust as needed
‚úÖ **Be confident** - You've researched, it's technically sound
‚úÖ **Ask for the business** - "Shall we start next week?"

### Don'ts
‚ùå **Don't over-technical** - They don't need to know about OAuth 2.0
‚ùå **Don't oversell** - Be realistic about projections
‚ùå **Don't ignore risks** - Address them proactively
‚ùå **Don't rush** - Let them ask questions
‚ùå **Don't leave without next steps** - Get commitments

## üéØ Key Messages to Drive Home

### 1. This Is Low Risk
"We'll pilot with 100 leads first. If it doesn't work, we adjust. You're not committing to all 1,000 on day one."

### 2. This Saves Advisor Time
"Your advisors only talk to interested customers. No more cold calling people who aren't ready."

### 3. This Pays for Itself Fast
"System costs ¬£8,440 for Year 1. That's 19 renewals. You have 1,000 leads."

### 4. This Is Happening Soon
"We can launch in 2 weeks. Perfect timing for the busy season."

### 5. This Is Simple & Reliable
"Better to do the basics perfectly than get fancy and break things. This is family business - we'll treat it like our own."

---

## üî• Handling Common Objections

### "That's expensive"
**Response:** "Let's look at the ROI. Each renewal is ¬£450 commission. This system costs ¬£8,440 for the year. That's 19 renewals to break even. You have 1,000 leads. Even if we only improve conversion by 5%, that's 50 renewals = ¬£22,500. The system pays for itself 2.6x over."

### "What if customers don't like SMS?"
**Response:** "Clear opt-out in every message. Industry data shows 90%+ prefer SMS for appointment reminders. Plus, we're piloting with 100 first - if opt-out rate is high, we adjust messaging or channel."

### "Can't we just do this manually?"
**Response:** "You could, but will you? With 1,000 leads? Consistently? At exactly 6, 5, and 4 months? Without forgetting anyone? This runs 24/7 without you thinking about it."

### "We need to think about it"
**Response:** "Absolutely. What specific concerns can I address? Would it help to see a demo with dummy data? Or talk to another client who's used similar systems?"

### "Our data is messy"
**Response:** "That's fine. Part of the setup is data validation. We'll identify issues during the pilot with 100 leads, then clean before full launch."

## üöÄ Your Closing Statement

**End every presentation with this:**

"Anthony, here's what I recommend: Let's start with a pilot of 100 leads next week. Low risk, quick to launch, easy to adjust. If the numbers look good after 48 hours, we scale to the full 1,000. If not, we regroup and adjust.

I've built 47 workflows like this. The tech is solid. The business case is strong. And this is family - I'll treat it like my own.

Shall we get started?"

**Then wait for them to respond. Don't fill the silence.**
