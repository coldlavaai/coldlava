# KTFS Mortgage Renewal Automation - Quick Summary
## One-Page Overview for Anthony

**From:** Oliver Tatler - Cold Lava
**Date:** 29 October 2025
**Project:** Automated SMS Mortgage Renewal System

---

## What We're Building

An automated system that sends timely SMS reminders to mortgage holders before their fixed-rate expires, allows them to book consultations via text message, and escalates non-responders to advisors for phone follow-up.

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Automated SMS Reminders
- **6 months before expiry:** First friendly reminder
- **5 months before expiry:** Second reminder
- **4 months before expiry:** Final reminder
- All messages personalized with customer name and advisor name
- Sent automatically at 10am daily based on Salesforce data

### Step 2: Two-Way SMS Booking
- Customer replies "YES" or "BOOK"
- System responds with 3 available time slots
- Customer picks a slot (replies 1, 2, or 3)
- Appointment automatically created in Reapit calendar
- Confirmation sent to customer and advisor

### Step 3: Phone Call Escalation
- At **3.5 months** before expiry, if no response
- System creates high-priority task in Salesforce
- Assigned to the customer's advisor
- Advisor makes personal phone call
