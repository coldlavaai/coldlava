# KTFS Mortgage Renewal Automation
## Transforming Your Customer Engagement

**Presented to:** Anthony - KTFS Leadership
**Prepared by:** Oliver Tatler - Cold Lava
**Date:** October 2025

---

# 📊 The Opportunity

### You Have
- **1,000 mortgage holders** with expiring fixed rates
- Valuable customer relationships built over years
- Expert advisors ready to help

### The Challenge
- Manual tracking is time-consuming
- Customers forget about expiry dates
- By the time you call, some have already renewed elsewhere
- Advisors spend time chasing leads who aren't ready

### The Cost
**Each missed renewal = £400-500 lost commission**

---

# 💡 The Solution

## Automated SMS Reminder System

**Intelligent, timely, personalized outreach at scale**

### What It Does
1. **Remembers for you** - Automatically tracks all 1,000 expiry dates
2. **Reaches out proactively** - SMS at 6, 5, and 4 months before expiry
3. **Books appointments** - Customers can book via text message
4. **Escalates strategically** - Non-responders flagged for advisor phone calls
5. **Logs everything** - Full tracking in Salesforce

### What Your Advisors Get
- Only talk to interested customers
- Pre-scheduled appointments
- Full context before each call
- More time to close deals, less time chasing

---

# 🎯 How It Works

## Step 1: Automated Reminders

**Every day at 10:00 AM, the system:**

```
✓ Checks Salesforce for upcoming expiry dates
✓ Identifies customers at 6, 5, and 4 months out
✓ Sends personalized SMS with advisor's name
✓ Logs all activity in Salesforce
```

**Example Message:**
> "Hi John, this is Sarah Williams from KTFS. Your fixed-rate mortgage expires in 24 weeks. Let's discuss your renewal options. Reply YES to book a call. Reply STOP to opt out."

**Customer receives timely reminder without any manual work from your team.**

---

# 📱 Step 2: Two-Way SMS Booking

**When customer replies "YES":**

```
Customer → "YES"
    ↓
System → "Great! I have availability on:
          1) Tue 5th Nov at 2:00pm
          2) Wed 6th Nov at 10:00am
          3) Thu 7th Nov at 3:00pm
          Reply 1, 2, or 3 to confirm."
    ↓
Customer → "2"
    ↓
System → Creates appointment in Reapit
         Updates Salesforce
         Sends confirmation to customer
         Notifies advisor
    ↓
✅ BOOKED
```

**From first message to booked appointment in under 2 minutes.**

**No phone tag. No back-and-forth emails. No missed calls.**

---

# 📞 Step 3: Smart Escalation

**If customer doesn't respond after 3 SMS:**

At **3.5 months** before expiry, system automatically:

1. ⚠️ Creates high-priority task in Salesforce
2. 👤 Assigns to customer's advisor
3. 📋 Includes full context: "3 SMS sent, no response. Expires in 15 weeks."
4. 📧 Sends notification to advisor

**Advisor makes personal phone call with full context.**

**Nothing falls through the cracks. Every customer gets proper follow-up.**

- Fixed rate 2.5% ending
- Assigned to advisor Sarah Williams
- Busy professional, hard to reach by phone

---

## John's Experience

### 15 August 2025 (6 months out)
**10:00 AM** - John's phone buzzes
> "Hi John, this is Sarah Williams from KTFS. Your fixed-rate mortgage expires in 24 weeks. Let's discuss your renewal options. Reply YES to book a call. Reply STOP to opt out."

**John's thought:** *"Oh right, I should sort that. I'll reply quickly."*

**10:15 AM** - John replies while having coffee
> "YES"

---

### Instant Response
**10:15 AM** - Immediate reply
> "Great! I have availability on: 1) Tue 20th Aug at 2:00pm, 2) Wed 21st Aug at 10:00am, 3) Thu 22nd Aug at 3:00pm. Reply 1, 2, or 3 to confirm."

**John's thought:** *"Wednesday morning works. This is so easy."*

> "2"

---

### Confirmation

**John's thought:** *"Done! That took 2 minutes. Much easier than calling."*

---

### Behind the Scenes
While John goes about his day, the system:

✅ Created appointment in Reapit (Sarah's calendar)
✅ Updated Salesforce with booking details
✅ Emailed Sarah with John's context
✅ Set reminder for 24 hours before

**Total time:** 2 minutes from first message to confirmed appointment
**Advisor time:** 0 minutes (Sarah just shows up prepared on Wednesday)

---

### 21 August 2025 - The Call
**Sarah calls John at 10:00 AM**

Sarah has full context:
- John responded quickly (engaged customer)
- Mortgage expires in 6 months
- Current rate ending
- Property details from Salesforce

**30-minute consultation**
- Review current rate and payment
- Explore new product options
- Discuss financial goals
- Agree on next steps

**Result:** John renews with KTFS. £450 commission. Happy customer retained.

---

### What If John Hadn't Replied?

**15 September (5 months)** - Another friendly SMS
**15 October (4 months)** - Final SMS reminder
**30 October (3.5 months)** - Task created for Sarah to call

**Sarah calls John personally:**
"Hi John, I've sent a couple of messages about your mortgage expiry. Just wanted to make sure you're on top of it. Can we chat?"

**Still captured. Nothing missed.**
