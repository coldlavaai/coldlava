---

## Critical Information Needed

### 1. FCA Authorization Number
**Question:** What is KTFS's FCA authorization number?

**Why we need it:** This must be included in SMS messages for regulatory compliance. All financial services communications must identify the authorized firm.

---

### 3. Current Conversion Rate (Baseline)
**Question:** Of the ~1,000 mortgage holders currently in the system, how many typically renew through KTFS?

**Context:** This helps us measure success. If you currently get 10% renewal rate and we increase it to 20%, that's a clear win.

**Answer:** Currently about ___% renew through KTFS (or ___ out of 1,000)

### 4. Twilio Phone Number Preference
**Question:** What type of phone number do you want for sending SMS messages?

**Options:**
- [ ] UK Mobile number (e.g., +44 7XXX XXXXXX) - **Recommended**

**Why we need it:** Mobile numbers work best for two-way SMS conversations. Will purchase through existing Twilio account.

**Preference:** _________________

### 5. Advisor Name Usage in SMS
**Question:** Should SMS messages include the specific advisor's name, or just say "KTFS team"?

**Option A (Personalized):**

**Preference:** [ ] Option A (advisor names)  [ ] Option B (generic)

**Why it matters:** Personalization typically increases response rates, but requires advisor names to be stored correctly in Salesforce.

### 6. Complex Question Handling

**Option A:** Reply with "Great question! [Advisor Name] can discuss rates in detail. Would you like to book a call?"
