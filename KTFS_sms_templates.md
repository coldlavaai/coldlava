## 24-Hour Reminder (Optional - Post-Launch Feature)

## FCA Compliance Addendum (Optional)

If required by KTFS's compliance team, add this to the first message only:

```
KTFS is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA number: [NUMBER]). Your home may be repossessed if you do not keep up repayments on your mortgage.
```

**Character count:** ~180 characters

**Note:** This makes the first message ~340 characters total (3 SMS messages). Most firms don't include this in SMS due to length, but it's good practice to include it in email follow-ups or on the booking confirmation page.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Include FCA number in confirmation email, not SMS (to keep SMS short and actionable).
